        <h3>Director of Product Management</h3>
        <p>Joey was by far one of the best designers I have ever worked with. He was always able to take my direction/ product requests and elevate the designs beyond what I had originally considered. His designs were dev smart and backed by his extensive experience in UX/UI understanding. He went above and beyond to explain design concepts and consideration when presenting his ideals to the team. I would work with Joey again anytime! Such a rockstar!</p>
